## Hello, I'm ElijahDoesCoding!
I am a Independent Devloper that owns The FUNPaint Team. I develop with another person only so I work as a group of two. I enjoy making software with AI while ensuring that things work. I develop with Visual Studio Code and publish on GitHub. Visual Studio Code is a free Development Software built on Open Source and by Microsoft. This website your on right now which is GitHub is by Microsoft and is completely free with optional plans. It is used for Open Source Development. I also am willing to add stuff to my Repositorys with request. For most of my stuff, please checkout The FUNPaint Team. And I would love contributions as I am not good at that much coding and FUNPaint is python and I can't do python. Well, See you at The FUNPaint Team!
